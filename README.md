# AI Mini Project: Manhattan Distance Algorithm

Welcome to my AI mini project repository. This project explores the application of the Manhattan Distance Algorithm in solving the 8-puzzle problem, a classic problem in artificial intelligence and machine learning.


## Introduction

This project is part of my AI coursework in the II year of my B.E. CSE program. The Manhattan Distance Algorithm is utilized to find the most cost-effective path to solve the 8-puzzle problem.

## Project Overview

The Manhattan Distance Algorithm measures the distance between two points in a coordinate system. It is commonly used in games and web-based maps for finding the shortest path efficiently.

## Algorithm

### Manhattan Distance Algorithm

### Rules for Solving the Puzzle

1. Visualize moving the empty space in place of the tile, essentially swapping the tile with the empty space.
2. The empty space can move in four directions: Up, Down, Right, Left.
3. The empty space cannot move diagonally and can take only one step at a time.

### Practice Problems

Given an initial state of an 8-puzzle problem and a final state to be reached, the goal is to find the most cost-effective path using the Manhattan Distance Algorithm.
